function [S,P, H] = BuildMultifractalTreeFn(MaxOffspring, MaxGens, ITERATIONS)

% The function generates a multifractal tree through iterative
% branching and scale assignment, returning matrices of progeny structure (P),
% scale assignments (S), and entropy values (H) for each lineage path. It
% effectively generates the random iterated function system.
%
% INPUTS:
%   MaxOffspring  - maximum number of offspring any node can have
%   MaxGens       - maximum number of generations in each tree
%   ITERATIONS    - number of nested iterations to apply; determines tree depth
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   S - a matrix of scale values assigned to each node in each generation
%   P - a matrix of progeny counts tracking tree structure over generations
%   H - an entropy matrix derived from the logarithmic scale changes
%
% The function recursively constructs a stochastic multifractal tree using
% a Galton–Watson process with randomly assigned scales. Each subtree is 
% expanded in parallel, and the full branching structure is recovered to 
% construct explicit ancestor-descendant matrices. Entropy is computed as 
% the log-change in scale across levels for each path.

% The number of offspring of every leaf at every iterate has been 
% recorded in Progenies, and likewise the scale of every leaf at every 
% iterate has been recorded in Leaves. These data structures need to be 
% converted to matrices that have N rows and as many columns as there are
% leaves in the final iterate. Doing so will make ancestral relationships
% explicit. Columns of the matrices will then correspond to distinct paths
% through the tree of life. Constructing these matrices requires
% determining how many times each member of every cell except the last of
% Progenies (and Leaves) must be repeated and populated in the matrix.
% Basically, the ancestral relationships are being back constructed using
% the information in Progenies, and then P and S are constructed via these
